v0.2
  REMOVED - Put casting and type conversion on compiler side. (not on __core execution)

v0.3
  + String class
  + Integrate real with Number class
  - Use proper Assign for field initialization (otherwise it's like having a pointer to the literal instance)
  [BUG]- Local field initialization not working
  - List and Dictionary classes
  - FOR statement
  - SWITCH statement
  - '=>' link operation (like pointers. Copy address and point to class instance. Useful for garbage collection)
  OK - [BUG]- (this + "a").Print(); 
  [BUG]- For list read return the S_LIST_ITEM and not the payload. Otherwise list is like a global object (see __core_exe_statement).
  - Method arguments must be sa local field with initialized value from call argument
  - Garbage collection and reusable class instances in class_CreateInstance
    + Use a list in the global class with all the created instances. If list is not empty pull from that, otherwise create new instance
    + Always call constructor and fields initialization
  - Full class inheritance
  - Method / Field override behaviour

v0.4
  - Try / Catch
  - Reflections
  - Regex (using class ?)
  - JSON (using class ?)

v?
  - JSON export / import for every object
  - Dump / Load all memory to a JSON (like saving a snapshot for old NES games)
  - GIT like included features for "seamless" switch to changes in software (using above feature JSON dump/load)
  - Method failover (default return with generic exception)
  - Async methods
  - Generics in classes (like C#)
